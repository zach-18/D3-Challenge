# D3-Challenge

I was able to complete the required part of the assignment,
but not the optional component.

The activities were helpful to find code that was useful for this
assignment.

The hardest part was the labels for the circles, but I was able to 
find the solution by combining Office Hours hints from our TA Mo, 
and research on Google.

Thanks,
Phil
